# Group Project: Survival and Gene Expressions Analysis of Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD)

## A concise summary of contributions of each group member (1 pts)

Our group tasks divided into five steps, including project topic background information research, Data Dexcrption and Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Modeliing Building, and results interpretation. 
Our group members include Hassan Ali, Simran Samra, Sophia Li and me. Hassian and Simran are from Biology background, and one works in UC cancer and another has experience in Heart Lung Innovation. Sophia and I are from Statistical background. Both of us have strong data analysis coding stills but lack of the experience in analyze high dimensional Genomic data. Based on the each member's academic backgroup, Hassan and Simran are assigned to the background information research ("blue task"), on the other hand, Sophia and I mainly focus on the model building ("yellow task"). Data Dexcrption and Wrangling, EDA and results interpretation ("green tasks") were done all together.

## Your specific contributions and comments (1 pts)


## Answer to one question specific to your project (3 points)

Questions:
1.	What is your rationale for mostly analyzing the top 10 genes, and not for instance genes that pass FDR, or some other number of top genes? How do you think this impacted your results?
2.	What is the purpose of heatmap on slide 12, and what do you wish to understand from this and what conclusions did you make?
3.	You mentioned that your dataset consists of only cancer patients. Would it help your analysis to have control samples (healthy) as well? How?
