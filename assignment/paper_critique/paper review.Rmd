### Goals and findings of the paper.

Researchers suspect that hereditary deafness is often caused by pathogenic variants in hair cell genes. Subsequently, they have conducted a RNA-Seq study which explored the gene expression in hair cell during mouse inner ear development. different gene expression patterns are found in different cell types (hair cells and surrounding cells), tissues sourses (cochlea and utricle) and development stages(E16, P0, P4 and P7). Additionally, the expression of genes critical for mechanotransduction and deafness are founded in hair cell which shows the possibility of the discovery of unknown deafness genes in hair cells.



### Datasets, experiments and relevant analysis
1. Since the hair cells are embedded in sensory epithelium with a variety of other cell types, enzymatic treatment was used to dissociate hair cells from surrounding cells. The FACs technique was used to further purify hair cells using the brighest GFP fluorescence signal to collect hair cells and the lowest fluorescence signal to collect other cells. 

2. The dataset contains the expression of 20,207 REfSeq mouse genes from 16 samples with three factors: cell types, tissue sources and developmental stages. The sequencing libraries converted from 3'-enriched transcriptome tags that have similar gene length. Gene expression levels were measured using RPKM (Reads Per kilobase of thanscript per Milion mapped reads) in log2 scale.

3. Several data visulization methods were used to find interesting differences between factor levels. FIrstly, Principle component analysis was used to plot the normalized gene expression data though reduceing the number of axes needed to display the important aspects of the data. Secondly, DESeq package was also used to identify differentially expressed genes between hair and surrounding cells and cochlear and utricular hair cells. Finally, histograms were used to display and compare the normalized number of reads for sepcific genes in different cells, tissue sources and devlopment stages. 

4. Fold change(FC) value was used to represent how big the relative difference is between selected highly enriched hair (GFP+) and surrounding cells (GFP-). It is defined as the GFP+/GFP- counts ratio.

5. Flase discovery rate(FDR) was determined using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. It shows the rate of type I errors in hypothesis testing when conducting mutiple comparsions between different gene expression across cells, organs and ages. 

6. Hierarchical clustering heat maps were used to show patial and temporal expression patterns of genes at various developmetal stages. The distance of different genes are defined as correlation of two genes across samples, and the centroid linkage method was used to determine the distance between gene clusters. 

### Comments and discussions
This study intented to comprehend the hair cells gene expression specific for vestibular and cochlear HCs during mouse development and to discover unknown deafness genes. Serval pairwise and multiple comparsions were conducted by ploting the data to illustrate different gene expression patterns. However, I cannot find their differential expression analysis models or any p-values to show statistical significance. The analytical mothods are rather simple, and 
most of analysis steps are still at the stage of exploratory data analysis. Statistical models are suggested to be used to further confirm the findings.
